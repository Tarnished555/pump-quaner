Beyond Pump is a tool designed to automate buying and selling tokens on the Solana blockchain. It executes trades based on user-defined parameters and strategies.

The bot can monitor market conditions in real-time, such as pool burns, minting authority relinquishments, and other factors, executing trades when conditions are met.
